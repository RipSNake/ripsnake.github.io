Hello there !

My name is Sebastian Javier Guzman and I'm from Argentina.

Three years from now I discovered the amazing world of computer programming and on my free time I try to learn as much as I can.

With the intention of making a career change and get into the world of technology and development, I'm gonna start coding and uploading some of my works.

Hope to hear from you, and feel free to contact me whenever you want !
